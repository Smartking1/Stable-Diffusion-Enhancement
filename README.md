# Stable-Diffusion-Enhancement

# üì∏ Culturally-Aware AI Image Generator Prototype

---

## üåç Project Overview

This project is a **small-scale AI pipeline prototype** built for the **Nsibidi Fables Generative AI Engineer Technical Assessment**.  
Its purpose is to demonstrate the ability to **generate culturally rich images** from user prompts using **Stable Diffusion** models, while **handling prompt enhancement, dataset management, metadata storage, database design, and logging** professionally.

The system accepts a **culturally specific user prompt** (e.g., "Yoruba man in agbada under a palm tree"), intelligently **analyzes and enriches** it using a **local Llama language model**, generates a **high-quality culturally accurate image**, and then **logs all details** into a **SQLite database**.

---

## üéØ Core Features

- **Prompt Analyzer**: Breaks down user prompts into cultural elements.
- **Prompt Enhancement with Llama**: Enriches simple prompts into vivid, culturally detailed prompts.
- **Stable Diffusion Image Generation**: Produces high-quality images from enhanced prompts.
- **Structured Metadata Storage**: Saves details about every generation.
- **SQLite Database System**: Stores prompts, images, and cultural elements relationally.
- **Professional Logging System**: Logs both to console and a `.log` file.
- **Modular Codebase**: Clear separation of concerns ‚Äî analyzers, generators, storage, logging.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Frameworks Used

| Tool/Library | Purpose |
|:------------|:---------|
| Python 3.10+ | Core programming language |
| Hugging Face `diffusers` | Stable Diffusion model loading |
| `ctransformers` | Local Llama-2 model loading |
| SQLite3 | Lightweight database for metadata |
| Python `logging` | File and console logging |
| Google Colab / Local | Run environment |

# üìö System Workflow

Here‚Äôs how the complete pipeline works:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt Input

The user provides a simple cultural text prompt, for example:
```text
Yoruba man in agbada under a palm tree
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt Analyzer (Cultural Understanding)

The **Prompt Analyzer** module parses the input and **identifies key cultural components**:

| Element | Example Extraction |
|:--------|:-------------------|
| Person | Yoruba man |
| Clothing | agbada |
| Environment | palm tree |
| Objects | (if mentioned) |

This breakdown gives structure and understanding to the raw prompt.

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
Understanding individual cultural elements helps create **more vivid, respectful, and accurate enhanced prompts**.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt Enhancement using Llama (Cultural Richness Layer)

The prompt is then passed to open source LLM **Llama model 'llama3-8b-8192'** through Groq API.

The system **instructs llama3-8b-8192** with a carefully designed prompt to:
- Add **specific cultural clothing** descriptions.
- Set an **authentic environment**.
- Add a **mood or action**.
- Keep it **short but visually rich**.

üîµ **Example:**
Input:
```text
Yoruba man in agbada under a palm tree
```

Enhanced Output:
```text
A proud Yoruba man dressed in flowing white agbada stands under a sprawling ancient palm tree, with the golden sunset lighting up a serene village scene.
```

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
This **bridges the cultural representation gap** that many generic models suffer from ‚Äî making generations **authentic and cultural aware**.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Image Generation with Stable Diffusion

The **enhanced culturally-rich prompt** is then passed to a **CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4** using Hugging Face `diffusers`.

```python
image = pipe(enhanced_prompt).images[0]
```

The generated image is:
- High resolution,
- Culturally appropriate,
- Reflects the enhanced description.

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
Ensures that the AI-generated visuals are **not generic**, but **rooted in the user's cultural background**.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Metadata Preparation

After image generation, the system collects important metadata:

- Original prompt
- Enhanced prompt
- Model name
- Timestamp
- Image file path
- Image size
- Detected cultural elements (from analysis)

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Storage: Database Handling (SQLite)

The project includes a **full SQLite-based metadata storage system**, implemented via the `MockDatabase` class.

üîµ **Two Tables**:
| Table | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `generations` | Stores metadata about each generated image |
| `cultural_elements` | Stores detected cultural components linked to each image |

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
Allows **structured querying** later ‚Äî e.g., "show all images involving 'agbada'" ‚Äî and supports **scalability**.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Professional Logging

The system initializes a **formal logging system** that:

- Writes logs both to **console** and a **persistent file** (`image_generator.log`).
- Includes **timestamps**, **logger name**, and **log level**.
- Captures key actions like:
  - Database initialization
  - Table creation
  - Image generation events
  - Metadata saving
  - Errors (if expanded in the future)

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
Facilitates **debugging**, **monitoring**, and **operational transparency**.
