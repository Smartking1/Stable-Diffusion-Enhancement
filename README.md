# Stable-Diffusion-Enhancement

# üì∏ Culturally-Aware AI Image Generator Prototype

---

## üåç Project Overview

This project is a **small-scale AI pipeline prototype** built for the **Nsibidi Fables Generative AI Engineer Technical Assessment**.  
Its purpose is to demonstrate the ability to **generate culturally rich images** from user prompts using **Stable Diffusion** models, while **handling prompt enhancement, dataset management, metadata storage, database design, and logging** professionally.

The system accepts a **culturally specific user prompt** (e.g., "Yoruba man in agbada under a palm tree"), intelligently **analyzes and enriches** it using a **local Llama language model**, generates a **high-quality culturally accurate image**, and then **logs all details** into a **SQLite database**.

---

## üéØ Core Features

- **Prompt Analyzer**: Breaks down user prompts into cultural elements.
- **Prompt Enhancement with Llama**: Enriches simple prompts into vivid, culturally detailed prompts.
- **Stable Diffusion Image Generation**: Produces high-quality images from enhanced prompts.
- **Structured Metadata Storage**: Saves details about every generation.
- **SQLite Database System**: Stores prompts, images, and cultural elements relationally.
- **Professional Logging System**: Logs both to console and a `.log` file.
- **Modular Codebase**: Clear separation of concerns ‚Äî analyzers, generators, storage, logging.

# üìö System Workflow

Here‚Äôs how the complete pipeline works:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt Input

The user provides a simple cultural text prompt, for example:
```text
Yoruba man in agbada under a palm tree
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt Analyzer (Cultural Understanding)

The **Prompt Analyzer** module parses the input and **identifies key cultural components**:

| Element | Example Extraction |
|:--------|:-------------------|
| Person | Yoruba man |
| Clothing | agbada |
| Environment | palm tree |
| Objects | (if mentioned) |

This breakdown gives structure and understanding to the raw prompt.

The PromptAnalyzer class is designed to analyze a text prompt and automatically extract key details like cultural elements, general categories, subjects, colors, styles, and time of day.
It helps in understanding the context, setting, and characteristics described in any given text prompt ‚Äî especially those rich in African cultural references.

**Initialization**
When an instance of PromptAnalyzer is created, it sets up:

**Cultural Keywords:**
A dictionary containing specific African cultural references (e.g., ethnic groups like Yoruba, Igbo, Maasai, traditional clothing like agbada, kente, etc.), linked to their corresponding attributes (like region, type, etc.).

**General Categories:**
A dictionary that maps broad themes (e.g., portrait, landscape, urban, wildlife) to related keywords.

**Color Patterns:**
A list of common color-related words (e.g., red, blue, vibrant, pastel) to detect color themes in the prompt.

**Style Patterns:**
A list of popular artistic styles (e.g., realistic, cartoon, oil painting, cinematic) that might be mentioned in the prompt.

**Method: analyze(prompt)**
Takes a text prompt as input and returns a context dictionary summarizing the extracted information.

**It performs the following steps:**

**Preprocessing:**

Converts the prompt to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.

Splits the text into words.

**Cultural Element Detection:**

Scans for cultural keywords and records matching ethnic groups, clothing, settings, etc.

Flags the prompt as is_cultural = True if any cultural element is found.

**General Category Identification:**

Looks for general categories like portrait, landscape, urban, etc.

**Uses fallback heuristics:**

If "man", "woman", etc. are found ‚Üí assume portrait.

If nothing matches ‚Üí default to landscape.

**Subject Extraction:**

Identifies subjects like "man", "child", "elder", and adds them to the subjects list.

** Color Detection:**

Identifies any color-related words present in the prompt.

**Style Detection:**

Finds stylistic descriptions (e.g., "sketch", "digital art", "surrealist").

**Time of Day Extraction:**

Tries to guess the time setting from words like "morning", "sunset", "night".

**Prompt Length:**

Calculates the number of words in the prompt.

**Result:**

**Returns a dictionary summarizing all detected information:**

cultural_elements, general_category, subjects, colors, styles, time_of_day, prompt_length, and is_cultural.

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
Understanding individual cultural elements helps create **more vivid, respectful, and accurate enhanced prompts**.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt Enhancement using Llama (Cultural Richness Layer)

The prompt is then passed to open source LLM **Llama model 'llama3-8b-8192'** through Groq API.

The system **instructs llama3-8b-8192** with a carefully designed prompt to:
- Add **specific cultural clothing** descriptions.
- Set an **authentic environment**.
- Add a **mood or action**.
- Keep it **short but visually rich**.

üîµ **Example:**
Input:
```text
Yoruba man in agbada under a palm tree
```

Enhanced Output:
```text
A proud Yoruba man dressed in flowing white agbada stands under a sprawling ancient palm tree, with the golden sunset lighting up a serene village scene.
```

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
This **bridges the cultural representation gap** that many generic models suffer from ‚Äî making generations **authentic and cultural aware**.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Image Generation with Stable Diffusion

The **enhanced culturally-rich prompt** is then passed to a **CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4** using Hugging Face `diffusers`.

```python
image = pipe(enhanced_prompt).images[0]
```

The generated image is:
- High resolution,
- Culturally appropriate,
- Reflects the enhanced description.

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
Ensures that the AI-generated visuals are **not generic**, but **rooted in the user's cultural background**.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Metadata Preparation

After image generation, the system collects important metadata:

- Original prompt
- Enhanced prompt
- Model name
- Timestamp
- Image file path
- Image size
- Detected cultural elements (from analysis)

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Storage: Database Handling (SQLite)

The project includes a **full SQLite-based metadata storage system**, implemented via the `MockDatabase` class.

üîµ **Two Tables**:
| Table | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `generations` | Stores metadata about each generated image |
| `cultural_elements` | Stores detected cultural components linked to each image |

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
Allows **structured querying** later ‚Äî e.g., "show all images involving 'agbada'" ‚Äî and supports **scalability**.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Professional Logging

The system initializes a **formal logging system** that:

- Writes logs both to **console** and a **persistent file** (`image_generator.log`).
- Includes **timestamps**, **logger name**, and **log level**.
- Captures key actions like:
  - Database initialization
  - Table creation
  - Image generation events
  - Metadata saving
  - Errors (if expanded in the future)

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
Facilitates **debugging**, **monitoring**, and **operational transparency**.
