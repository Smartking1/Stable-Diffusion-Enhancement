# üì∏ Culturally-Aware AI Image Generator Pipeline

## üåç Project Overview

This project is a **small-scale AI pipeline prototype** built for the **Nsibidi Fables Generative AI Engineer Technical Assessment**.  
Its purpose is to demonstrate the ability to **generate culturally rich images** from user prompts using **Stable Diffusion** models, while **handling prompt enhancement, dataset management, metadata storage, database design, and logging** professionally.

The system accepts a **culturally specific user prompt** (e.g., "Yoruba man in agbada under a palm tree"), intelligently **analyzes and enriches** it using a **local Llama language model**, generates a **high-quality culturally accurate image**, and then **logs all details** into a **SQLite database**.

# üìö System Workflow

Here‚Äôs how the complete pipeline works:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt Input

The user provides a simple cultural text prompt, for example:
```text
Yoruba man in agbada under a palm tree
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt Analyzer (Cultural Understanding)

The **Prompt Analyzer** module parses the input and **identifies key cultural components**:

| Element | Example Extraction |
|:--------|:-------------------|
| Person | Yoruba man |
| Clothing | agbada |
| Environment | palm tree |
| Objects | (if mentioned) |

This breakdown gives structure and understanding to the raw prompt.

The PromptAnalyzer class is designed to analyze a text prompt and automatically extract key details like cultural elements, general categories, subjects, colors, styles, and time of day.
It helps in understanding the context, setting, and characteristics described in any given text prompt ‚Äî especially those rich in African cultural references.

**Initialization**
When an instance of PromptAnalyzer is created, it sets up:

**Cultural Keywords:**
A dictionary containing specific African cultural references (e.g., ethnic groups like Yoruba, Igbo, Maasai, traditional clothing like agbada, kente, etc.), linked to their corresponding attributes (like region, type, etc.).

**General Categories:**
A dictionary that maps broad themes (e.g., portrait, landscape, urban, wildlife) to related keywords.

**Color Patterns:**
A list of common color-related words (e.g., red, blue, vibrant, pastel) to detect color themes in the prompt.

**Style Patterns:**
A list of popular artistic styles (e.g., realistic, cartoon, oil painting, cinematic) that might be mentioned in the prompt.

**Method: analyze(prompt)**
Takes a text prompt as input and returns a context dictionary summarizing the extracted information.

**It performs the following steps:**

**Preprocessing:**

Converts the prompt to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.

Splits the text into words.

**Cultural Element Detection:**

Scans for cultural keywords and records matching ethnic groups, clothing, settings, etc.

Flags the prompt as is_cultural = True if any cultural element is found.

**General Category Identification:**

Looks for general categories like portrait, landscape, urban, etc.

**Uses fallback heuristics:**

If "man", "woman", etc. are found ‚Üí assume portrait.

If nothing matches ‚Üí default to landscape.

**Subject Extraction:**

Identifies subjects like "man", "child", "elder", and adds them to the subjects list.

** Color Detection:**

Identifies any color-related words present in the prompt.

**Style Detection:**

Finds stylistic descriptions (e.g., "sketch", "digital art", "surrealist").

**Time of Day Extraction:**

Tries to guess the time setting from words like "morning", "sunset", "night".

**Prompt Length:**

Calculates the number of words in the prompt.

**Result:**

**Returns a dictionary summarizing all detected information:**

cultural_elements, general_category, subjects, colors, styles, time_of_day, prompt_length, and is_cultural.

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
Understanding individual cultural elements helps create **more vivid, respectful, and accurate enhanced prompts**.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt Enhancement using Llama (Cultural Richness Layer)

The GroqPromptEnhancer class is designed to enhance user-provided prompts for image generation tasks.
It uses Groq's Llama model to automatically generate richer, more vivid, and visually detailed prompts, improving image outputs while keeping the original intent intact.

**How it Works**
Initialization (__init__):

Initializes a Groq client using an API key.

If the API key is not provided, it tries to fetch it from the environment variable GROQ_API_KEY.

Loads predefined style templates (e.g., west_african, portrait, landscape, etc.) to help contextualize prompts for different scenarios.

**Selecting a Style Template (_get_appropriate_style_template):**

Based on the input context, it chooses the most suitable style template.

If a cultural region is detected (e.g., West Africa or East Africa), it uses a matching cultural template.

Otherwise, it falls back to a general category (like portrait, urban, etc.).

If no match is found, it uses a default general style.

**Enhancing the Prompt (enhance):**

Analyzes the user prompt and context to build a structured enhancement request.

**Sends a system message to Groq's Llama model explaining how to improve the prompt:**

Add artistic details (lighting, composition, textures)

Maintain original intent

Keep it concise but descriptive

Ensure cultural authenticity if needed

**Constructs a user message combining:**

The original prompt

A summary of detected subjects, styles, and cultural elements.

Calls Groq's Llama model to generate the enhanced prompt.

If the API call fails, it falls back to simply appending detailed, high quality, 8K to the original prompt.



üîµ **Example:**
Input:
```text
Yoruba man in agbada under a palm tree
```

Enhanced Output:
```text
A proud Yoruba man dressed in flowing white agbada stands under a sprawling ancient palm tree, with the golden sunset lighting up a serene village scene.
```

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
This **bridges the cultural representation gap** that many generic models suffer from ‚Äî making generations **authentic and cultural aware**.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Image Generation with Stable Diffusion

The StableDiffusionGenerator class is responsible for generating high-quality images from text prompts using a Stable Diffusion model.

It loads a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model onto your GPU and provides a method to create images based on both positive prompts (what you want to see) and negative prompts (what you want to avoid).

**How it Works**
Initialization (__init__):

Loads a Stable Diffusion model (default: "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4") using DiffusionPipeline from Hugging Face.

**Optimizes memory usage by:**

Clearing GPU cache (torch.cuda.empty_cache()).

Using bfloat16 precision for faster and more memory-efficient inference.

Enabling attention slicing (if supported), which reduces memory consumption during image generation.

Moves the model to the GPU ("cuda") for faster generation.

Prints the loading time once the model is ready.

**Generating an Image (generate_image):**

**Takes in:**

prompt: The enhanced positive text prompt.

context: Information about cultural or stylistic elements.

Optional: negative_prompt, width, and height for output size.

**Negative Prompt Handling:**

If no negative prompt is provided, a default negative prompt is used to filter out common image defects (e.g., "blurry", "bad anatomy", "extra limbs").

If cultural context is provided (e.g., West Africa, East Africa), culture-specific negative prompts are added to avoid whitewashing or inaccuracies.

If generating a portrait, it adds extra filtering for issues like "distorted face" or "multiple faces."

**Calls the Stable Diffusion pipeline to generate the image with:**

Guidance scale set to 7.5 (controls how strongly the model follows the prompt).

30 inference steps (controls image quality and detail).

Returns the generated image object.

The generated image is:
- High resolution,
- Culturally appropriate,
- Reflects the enhanced description.

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
Ensures that the AI-generated visuals are **not generic**, but **rooted in the user's cultural background**.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Metadata Preparation

After image generation, the system collects important metadata:

- Original prompt
- Enhanced prompt
- Model name
- Timestamp
- Image file path
- Image size
- Detected cultural elements (from analysis)

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Storage: Database Handling (SQLite)

The project includes a **full SQLite-based metadata storage system**, implemented via the `MockDatabase` class.

üîµ **Two Tables**:
| Table | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| `generations` | Stores metadata about each generated image |
| `cultural_elements` | Stores detected cultural components linked to each image |

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
Allows **structured querying** later ‚Äî e.g., "show all images involving 'agbada'" ‚Äî and supports **scalability**.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Professional Logging

The system initializes a **formal logging system** that:

- Writes logs both to **console** and a **persistent file** (`image_generator.log`).
- Includes **timestamps**, **logger name**, and **log level**.
- Captures key actions like:
  - Database initialization
  - Table creation
  - Image generation events
  - Metadata saving
  - Errors (if expanded in the future)

‚úÖ **Why Important?**  
Facilitates **debugging**, **monitoring**, and **operational transparency**.

## Sample of generated image

Prompt: Yoruba man in Agbada

Enhanced Prompt:A dignified Yoruba man in a majestic Agbada attire, standing against a warm, golden-lit backdrop of traditional West African patterns, with intricate brocade and embroidery adorning his fabric, worn over a crisp white shirt and matching trousers, with a subtle smile and a sense of pride, in high resolution

## Limitations

Some advanced open-source text-to-image models require more powerful GPUs than what is available on Google Colab‚Äôs free tier. Specifically, the **T4 GPU** provided by Colab Free is **not sufficient** to run these larger models efficiently.

However, **testing the enhanced prompts** generated by the AI pipeline on **Hugging Face‚Äôs Inference interface for testing models** ‚Äî using more advanced models like **stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers** ‚Äî produced **excellent results**.  
This demonstrates that with access to a **stronger text-to-image model**, the AI pipeline is capable of generating even **higher quality and more culturally accurate images**.

> **Below is a sample image generated using the enhanced, culturally-aware prompt with the Stability AI model (Stable Diffusion 3 Medium):**
